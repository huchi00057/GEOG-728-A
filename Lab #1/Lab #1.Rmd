```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

# On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.

## Create a named numerical variable and a new vector of numbers.

```{r}
# assign a and b as numerical variable
a <- 5
b <- 17

#  assign d as a vector of numbers
d <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

## Report these produced data objects and then apply at least two functions to each.


```{r}
# sum would be a + b
sum(a, b)

# mean would be the average of a and be, that is (a+b)/2
mean(a, b)

# standard deviation of the vector d 
sd(d)

# max would the biggest number within the vector d 
max(d)

# lengh would be the number of elements in the vector d 
length(d)
```

## Create a new data frame with three columns and rows.

```{r tri_df_data, results='asis'}
library(knitr)

tri_df <- data.frame(name = c("SpongeBob", "Tom&Jerry", "Sesame Street"),
                     character = c("Sandy", "Jerry", "Cookie Monster"),
                     color = c("brown", "brown", "blue"),
                     finger_num = c(5, 5, 2))
kable(tri_df)
```

## Load a dataset from the R package and report summary information on the dataset and its structure.

```{r}
library(MASS)

# Show the first few rows of the dataset
head(ChickWeight)
```

## Use the ls() function to see that the objects are stored in your workspace. Clear your workspace using the rm(list = ls()) function. Then, run the ls() function to make sure the objects are gone.

```{r}
# the original objects include of a, b, d, tri_df
ls()

# then, remove them
rm(list = ls())

# show again to check what's objects inside, and it's empty now
ls()
```

# line under words.
<u> Here is the practice of non-standard text formatting.<u>

# Delete line under words.
~~ And this example would try to show delete lines in sentence.~~

# bigger border of words.
** Those words would be stronger.**

# List example：
+ text describing what you are doing - finished
+ multiple code chunks where you run actual R code - finished
+ text describing the output - finished
+ an image - Github Screenshot
+ text headers - # List example：
+ at least two examples of non-standard text formatting - line under words, Delete line, bigger border of words
+ one list - Here
