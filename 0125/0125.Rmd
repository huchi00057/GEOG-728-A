```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Class Practice

```{r}
#install.packages("yarrr")

library("yarrr")

#?pirateplot

pirateplot(formula = weight ~ Time, 
           data = ChickWeight,
           pal = "xmen")
```

```{r}

IDs <- 1:50

IDs <- seq(from = 0.5, to = 90, by = 2)

obs <- rep(IDs, 3)

obs <- rep(IDs, length.out = 200)

obs <- rep(IDs, length.out = length(IDs)*5)

pets <- c("cats", "dogs", "squirrels?")

pets_rep <- rep(pets, length.out = 45)

my_table <- cbind(IDs, pets_rep)

head(my_table)

```


### Reading Data In

butterfly data!!

```{r}
jn <- read.csv("journeynorth.csv")

jn2 <- read.csv("journeynorth2.csv")

str(jn)

head(jn2)

jn_full <-rbind(jn,jn2)

jn_full["Number" >500]

# Just show for Data, and it's the first column.
jn_full[,1]

# Show the first and sixth column, and they would be Date and Number.
jn_full[,c(1,6)]

# Show three columsï¼šData, Town, State.Province
jn_full[, 1:3]

# Error happens
jn_full[,1,2,3]

# 1/1/2020 Santa Cruz CA 37 -122 1
jn_full[1, ]

# 1/1/2020
jn_full[1, 1]

# Printed all data of Number
jn_full[, "Number"]

jn_full[jn_full$number > 5, ]

# How many NULL in jn_full
max(jn_full$Number, na.rm = T)
View(jn_full[jn_full$Number >= 5, ])
```
